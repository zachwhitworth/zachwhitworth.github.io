      “A gentleman and scholar.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He brings people together.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A new friend who feels like an old friend.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is not only talented and intelligent but devoted to alternative methods of publishing discourse and collective organizing in the field.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is a thoughtful and innovative scholar who has much to say about society. His ideas are urgent, pressing, and inciteful.”

        I've felt ambivalent about autobiographical statements for a while. I find myself oscillating between definitions and positions, never satisfied with one or the other. For instance, it's difficult for me to draw a line between my work as a writer and as an editor; as a designer and as a curator; as a scholar and as an art worker.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an alternative, I started to keep quotes from others who refer to me in conversations. It's less of who I believe myself to be—in theory, it's closer to how I will be remembered when I'm no longer around.
