      <i>I’m from the Umpqua Valley of the Pacific Northwest. This is an in-progress space for sharing activities and updates. If you want to get in touch, send me an email (1025orchard [at] gmail [dot] com).</i>

    <p>
      What I’ve been working on…
      <br>
I wrote an essay on speech for the upcoming issue of <a href="https://platesjournal.com/"><i>Plates Journal</i></a>, edited by <a href="https://caseycarsel.com/">Casey Carsel</a>. It’s representative of a major shift in my thinking on cosmic scales, possibly the most urgent piece I’ve written to date. COPY recently published <a href="https://readcopy.co/alternative-museum">my brief critique of alternative museums</a>, which I originally wrote at the beginning of the year. My old textwork “Messages to a Former Love” was printed in the new <a href="https://www.softqtrly.com/shop/p/summer21">Summer21 issue of <i>Soft</i></a>, which is available to purchase online and in select stores. I’m currently working on a case study of labor and utopia for the textile art journal <a href="https://feralfabric.com/"><i>Feral Fabric</i></a>. Other secret projects are also brewing. Aside from personal writing, I work with collections records at the <a href="https://www.lacarchive.com/">Los Angeles Contemporary Archive</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some activities earlier this year…
      <br>
A rare fiction piece of mine was published in <a href="https://www.gritsquarterly.com/shop/p/issue-3-revival">the third issue of <i>Grits</i></a>, which is available to buy digitally. My contribution to the publication <a href="https://thirdroom.net/you-are-here"><i>You Are Here</i></a> was on display with Unbound Press at the <a href="https://www.ipcny.org/mapping-narratives">International Print Center New York</a>, selected by <a href="https://www.blackwomenofprint.com/">Black Women of Print</a>. I was featured at <a href="https://pmvabf.org/">Printed Matter’s Virtual Art Book Fair</a> with the <a href="http://southland.institute/">Southland Institute</a>, including a prompt I wrote for an earlier program on art museums, authoritarianism, and protest. A year after it was initially planned, I finished editing a group video piece about the minimum wage for the <a href="https://conceptualstudies.org/">Institute for Conceptual Studies</a> and included an original text on wage labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I’m studying…
      <br>
I’m presently attending seminars in Philosophy, Art & Critical Thought at the <a href="https://egs.edu/">European Graduate School</a>. I’m reading Murray Bookchin’s <i>The Ecology of Freedom</i> with the <a href="http://communityreadinggroup.com/">Community Reading Group</a> (LA). <a href="http://www.feldmeth.net/index.html">Adam Feldmeth</a> and I are jointly theorizing on expressions and reactions, which may become something public in the future. On my own, I’ve been reading Michael Löwy’s <i>Redemption and Utopia</i> as well as Walter Benjamin’s <i>Moscow Diary</i>. I also set up my PlayStation for the first time in several years and am playing <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ongoing side project is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lv2lLmVxdWMN-7xA23frEw5LYdaUXGkDy61EGnDmIDo/edit?usp=sharing">Authoritarian History Film Archive</a>, a spreadsheet of films dealing with the subject of authoritarianism and its opposition. Each film included is available to watch online for free. The <a href="https://conceptualstudies.org/">Institute for Conceptual Studies</a>, a platform I started in 2019, has been on extended hiatus for mental health reasons. I’m focusing on myself in the meantime, figuring things out. I have still been growing the Institute’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_QGakpZgte3ovLuggI6ryXtg7h05h8HppBKTH7_DFpc/edit?usp=sharing">"Links"</a> document, a directory of helpful websites for those in orbit of the arts.

        <i>Last updated August 31, 2021.
          <br>
          After paying for a website through Format for years, I finally learned to code one by hand through a class at <a href="https://index-space.org/">Index</a>. Many thanks to <a href="https://megumi.co/">Megumi Tanaka</a> for getting me started. I am currently paying $15 USD a year for my domain and host the code on <a href="https://github.com/zachwhitworth/zachwhitworth.github.io">GitHub</a> for free. My favicon is a portrait of me drawn by my former first-grade student, Taven.
