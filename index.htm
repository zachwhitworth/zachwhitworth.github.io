      What I’ve been working on this last year…
      <br>
      I’m currently writing on the utopian commune of New Odessa (1881–1891) and the Religion of Humanity, with initial research supported by a grant from the <a href="https://www.culturaltrust.org/">Oregon Cultural Trust</a>. I edited artist books on the persistent growth of weeds by <a href="https://gloria-galvez.com/">gloria galvez</a> and a famous robbery in Ojai, California by <a href="https://haileyloman.com/">Hailey Loman</a>. <a href="https://construction.cedrictai.com/">Cedric Tai</a> and I are slowly formulating a workshop on hearsay and the spread of gossip. Several brief pieces I wrote on rationalism, propaganda, nuclear fusion, images, and time travel were also printed in the September and April 2022 issues of <i>The Paper</i> by <a href="https://goodpress.co.uk/">Good Press</a>. In the Spring, I discussed utopianism in the work of Walter Benjamin and Ernst Bloch for <a href="https://index-space.org/products/community-conversations-on-hope">a panel on hope</a> at Index, where I presented alongside <a href="https://www.instagram.com/analuisaf.jpg/">Ana Luisa Figueiredo</a> and <a href="https://maviscao.com/">Mavis Yue Cao</a>. <a href="http://www.feldmeth.net/index.html">Adam Feldmeth</a> and I continued to compile a dialogue on the <a href="https://egs.edu/">European Graduate School</a>’s PACT 2021 Online Session. By day, I work with the <a href="https://www.lacarchive.com/">Los Angeles Contemporary Archive</a> as their Description Archivist. On assignment for LACA, I led the processing of the Common Field collection, representing a decade of internal records from the now defunct networking organization.

      Some earlier activities…
      <br>
I wrote <a href="https://prtcls.com/article/whitworth-making-and-unmaking-city-centers/">a study of ritual architecture and the establishment of modern city centers</a> for <i>PROTOCOLS issue #10: TEMPLE</i> (eds. Lauren Levy & Ben Ratskoff eds). <a href="https://feralfabric.com/ZACH-set">My essay on Emily Ensminger’s utopian project <i>Housepitality</i> (2012–2020)</a> was published in <i>The Feral Fabric Journal volume 05: Labor</i> (eds. Paulina Berczynski & Amanda Walters). <a href="https://platesjournal.com/finding-the-words">Another piece of prose on language and war</a> appeared in <i>Plates issue 04: Craft</i> (ed. <a href="https://caseycarsel.com/">Casey Carsel</a>). <a href="https://readcopy.co/alternative-museum">A short critique of alternative museums</a>, with focus on the New Museum, was published by <i>COPY</i>. I completed a Certificate in Philosophy, Art & Critical Thought at the <a href="https://egs.edu/">European Graduate School</a>. My old textwork “Messages to a Former Love” was printed in the <a href="https://www.softqtrly.com/shop/p/summer21">Summer21 issue of <i>Soft</i></a>. A rare fiction piece of mine was published in the third issue of <i>Grits</i>. My contribution to the publication <a href="https://thirdroom.net/you-are-here"><i>You Are Here</i></a> was on display with Unbound Press in <a href="https://www.ipcny.org/mapping-narratives">“Mapping Narratives” at the International Print Center New York</a>. I was featured at <a href="https://pmvabf.org/">Printed Matter’s Virtual Art Book Fair</a> with the <a href="http://southland.institute/">Southland Institute</a>, including a prompt I developed for a program on art museums, authoritarianism, and protest. I edited a group video project and wrote an accompanying essay on the minimum wage for the <a href="https://conceptualstudies.org/">Institute for Conceptual Studies</a>. An infrequently ongoing side project is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lv2lLmVxdWMN-7xA23frEw5LYdaUXGkDy61EGnDmIDo/edit?usp=sharing">Authoritarian History Film Index</a>, a spreadsheet of films on authoritarianism and its opposition, all of which are available to watch online for free. I continue to grow my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_QGakpZgte3ovLuggI6ryXtg7h05h8HppBKTH7_DFpc/edit?usp=sharing">“Links”</a> document, a directory of helpful websites for those in orbit of the arts.

      What I’m studying…
      <br>
I attended courses in architecture and vexillology respectively led by <a href="https://www.sharon-leung.com/">Sharon Leung</a> and <a href="https://www.laurascofield.com/">Laura Scofield</a> at Index. Over the last year or so, I've enrolled in other classes with the <a href="http://southland.institute/">Southland Institute</a>, <a href="https://index-space.org/">Index</a>, and the <a href="https://thebrooklyninstitute.com/">Brooklyn Institute for Social Research</a>. I’m also a co-facilitator of the <a href="http://communityreadinggroup.com/">Community Reading Group</a>, which is currently reading Angela Davis’s <i>An Autobiography</i>. On my own, I recently finished reading David Wengrow’s <i>The Origins of Monsters</i> and watching the 1974 BBC televsion drama series <i>Fall of Eagles</i>. My brother and I have also been discussing ethics and imperialism in Rudyard Kipling’s <i>The Jungle Books</i> while exploring <i>Minecraft</i> together.

        <i>Last updated December 20, 2022.
          <br>
          After paying for a website through Format for years, I finally learned to code one by hand through a class at <a href="https://index-space.org/">Index</a>. Many thanks to <a href="https://megumi.co/">Megumi Tanaka</a> for getting me started. I am currently paying $15 USD a year for my domain and host the code on <a href="https://github.com/zachwhitworth/zachwhitworth.github.io">GitHub</a> for free. My favicon is a portrait of me drawn by my former first-grade student, Taven.
