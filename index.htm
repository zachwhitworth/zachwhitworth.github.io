      What I’ve been working on…
      <br>
      I’m currently writing an essay on the New Odessa Colony (1882–1887) and the Religion of Humanity, with initial research supported by a grant from the <a href="https://www.culturaltrust.org/">Oregon Cultural Trust</a>. My brief piece on time travel was also printed in the April 2022 issue of <i>The Paper</i> by <a href="https://goodpress.co.uk/">Good Press</a>. I recently discussed utopianism in the work of Walter Benjamin and Ernst Bloch for <a href="https://index-space.org/products/community-conversations-on-hope">a panel on hope</a> at Index, where I presented alongside <a href="https://www.instagram.com/analuisaf.jpg/">Ana Luisa Figueiredo</a> and <a href="https://maviscao.com/">Mavis Yue Cao</a>. <a href="http://www.feldmeth.net/index.html">Adam Feldmeth</a> and I continue to compile a dialogue on the <a href="https://egs.edu/">European Graduate School</a>’s PACT 2021 Online Session. By day, I work with the <a href="https://www.lacarchive.com/">Los Angeles Contemporary Archive</a>.

      Some activities last year…
      <br>
I wrote <a href="https://prtcls.com/article/whitworth-making-and-unmaking-city-centers/">a study of ritual architecture and the establishment of modern city centers</a> for <i>PROTOCOLS issue #10: TEMPLE</i> (eds. Lauren Levy & Ben Ratskoff eds). <a href="https://feralfabric.com/ZACH-set">My essay on Emily Ensminger’s utopian project Housepitality (2012–2020)</a> was published in <i>The Feral Fabric Journal volume 05: Labor</i> (eds. Paulina Berczynski & Amanda Walters). <a href="https://platesjournal.com/finding-the-words">Another piece of prose on language and war</a> appeared in <i>Plates issue 04: Craft</i> (ed. <a href="https://caseycarsel.com/">Casey Carsel</a>). <a href="https://readcopy.co/alternative-museum">A short critique of alternative museums</a>, with focus on the New Museum, was published by <i>COPY</i>. I completed a Certificate in Philosophy, Art & Critical Thought at the <a href="https://egs.edu/">European Graduate School</a>. My old textwork “Messages to a Former Love” was printed in the <a href="https://www.softqtrly.com/shop/p/summer21">Summer21 issue of <i>Soft</i></a>. A rare fiction piece of mine was published in the third issue of <i>Grits</i>. My contribution to the publication <a href="https://thirdroom.net/you-are-here"><i>You Are Here</i></a> was on display with Unbound Press in <a href="https://www.ipcny.org/mapping-narratives">“Mapping Narratives” at the International Print Center New York</a>. I was featured at <a href="https://pmvabf.org/">Printed Matter’s Virtual Art Book Fair</a> with the <a href="http://southland.institute/">Southland Institute</a>, including a prompt I developed for a program on art museums, authoritarianism, and protest. I edited a group video project and wrote an accompanying essay on the minimum wage for the <a href="https://conceptualstudies.org/">Institute for Conceptual Studies</a>. An infrequently ongoing side project is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lv2lLmVxdWMN-7xA23frEw5LYdaUXGkDy61EGnDmIDo/edit?usp=sharing">Authoritarian History Film Index</a>, a spreadsheet of films on authoritarianism and its opposition, all of which are available to watch online for free. I continue to grow my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_QGakpZgte3ovLuggI6ryXtg7h05h8HppBKTH7_DFpc/edit?usp=sharing">“Links”</a> document, a directory of helpful websites for those in orbit of the arts.

      What I’m studying…
      <br>
I’m presently enrolled in <a href="https://index-space.org/products/designing-spaces-for-humans">“Designing Spaces for Humans”</a>, an architecture course led by <a href="https://www.sharon-leung.com/">Sharon Leung</a> at Index. I’ve lately attended other classes with the <a href="http://southland.institute/">Southland Institute</a>, <a href="https://index-space.org/">Index</a>, and the <a href="https://thebrooklyninstitute.com/">Brooklyn Institute for Social Research</a>. I’m also a co-facilitator of the <a href="http://communityreadinggroup.com/">Community Reading Group</a>, which is currently reading Saidiya Hartman’s <i>Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments</i>. During the Winter, I sat through all 25 <i>James Bond</i> films to better understand the evolution of Anglo-American propaganda. In the Spring, I rewatched the <i>Blade Runner</i> and <i>The Matrix</i> films to consider their messianic tendencies. On my own, I’m reading James C. Scott’s <i>Against the Grain</i> and Murray Bookchin’s <i>Post-Scarcity Anarchism</i>. My brother and I have also been discussing Pyotr Kropotkin’s <i>Ethics: Origin and Development</i> while exploring <i>Minecraft</i> together.

        <i>Last updated July 18, 2022.
          <br>
          After paying for a website through Format for years, I finally learned to code one by hand through a class at <a href="https://index-space.org/">Index</a>. Many thanks to <a href="https://megumi.co/">Megumi Tanaka</a> for getting me started. I am currently paying $15 USD a year for my domain and host the code on <a href="https://github.com/zachwhitworth/zachwhitworth.github.io">GitHub</a> for free. My favicon is a portrait of me drawn by my former first-grade student, Taven.
