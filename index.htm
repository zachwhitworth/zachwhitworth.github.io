      What I’ve been working on…
      <br>
I wrote <a href="https://prtcls.com/article/whitworth-making-and-unmaking-city-centers/">a study of temples and the establishment of modern city centers</a> for <i>PROTOCOLS issue #10: TEMPLE</i> (Lauren Levy & Ben Ratskoff eds.), taking a look at how ritual architecture functions in time and social organization. My essay on <a href="https://feralfabric.com/ZACH-set">Emily Ensminger’s utopian project <i>Housepitality</i> (2012–2020)</a> was recently published in <i>Feral Fabric Journal volume 05: Labor</i> (Paulina Berczynski & Amanda Walters eds.), posing questions of labor’s function in the production of the future. <a href="https://platesjournal.com/finding-the-words">A piece of prose on speech and war</a> appeared in <i>Plates issue 04: Craft</i> (<a href="https://caseycarsel.com/">Casey Carsel</a> ed.). It's a proposal for the role of storytellers in challenging the destruction of human life and the natural world, representing a shift in my thinking on cosmic scales. Aside from personal writing, I work with collections records at the <a href="https://www.lacarchive.com/">Los Angeles Contemporary Archive</a> and am currently on a committee developing a new collection initiative.

      Some activities earlier this year…
      <br>
<a href="https://readcopy.co/alternative-museum">A short critique of alternative museums</a> was published by <i>COPY</i>, describing the dangers of operating in standard models. My old textwork “Messages to a Former Love” was printed in the <a href="https://www.softqtrly.com/shop/p/summer21">Summer21 issue of <i>Soft</i></a>, which is available to purchase online and in select stores. A rare fiction piece of mine was published in <a href="https://www.gritsquarterly.com/shop/p/issue-3-revival">the third issue of <i>Grits</i></a>, also available to buy digitally. My contribution to the publication <a href="https://thirdroom.net/you-are-here"><i>You Are Here</i></a> was on display with Unbound Press at the <a href="https://www.ipcny.org/mapping-narratives">International Print Center New York</a>, selected by <a href="https://www.blackwomenofprint.com/">Black Women of Print</a>. I was featured at <a href="https://pmvabf.org/">Printed Matter’s Virtual Art Book Fair</a> with the <a href="http://southland.institute/">Southland Institute</a>, including a prompt I wrote for an earlier program on art museums, authoritarianism, and protest. A year after it was initially planned, I finished editing a group video piece about the minimum wage for the <a href="https://conceptualstudies.org/">Institute for Conceptual Studies</a> and included an original text on wage labor.

      What I’m studying…
      <br>
I’m presently reading and discussing Mahmood Mamdani’s <i>Neither Settler Nor Native</i> with the <a href="http://communityreadinggroup.com/">Community Reading Group</a> (LA). I attended seminars in Philosophy, Art & Critical Thought at the <a href="https://egs.edu/">European Graduate School</a> during the late Summer and Fall, and the experience was thoroughly disappointing. In the late Fall, I took an illuminating class on Gershom Scholem and his philosophy of history at the <a href="https://thebrooklyninstitute.com/">Brooklyn Institute for Social Research</a>. <a href="http://www.feldmeth.net/index.html">Adam Feldmeth</a> and I have continued to jointly theorize on expression, reaction, and education. On my own, I’m reading Max Weber’s <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i> as well as Gustav Landauer’s <i>Revolution and Other Writings</i>. Occasionally, I’ve been playing <i>Terraria</i> before going to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      An infrequently ongoing side project is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lv2lLmVxdWMN-7xA23frEw5LYdaUXGkDy61EGnDmIDo/edit?usp=sharing">Authoritarian History Film Archive</a>, a spreadsheet of films dealing with the subject of authoritarianism and its opposition. Each film included is available to watch online for free. The <a href="https://conceptualstudies.org/">Institute for Conceptual Studies</a>, a platform I started in 2019, has been on extended hiatus. I’m focusing on myself in the meantime, figuring things out. I've still been growing the Institute’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_QGakpZgte3ovLuggI6ryXtg7h05h8HppBKTH7_DFpc/edit?usp=sharing">"Links"</a> document, a directory of helpful websites for those in orbit of the arts.

        <i>Last updated December 17, 2021.
          <br>
          After paying for a website through Format for years, I finally learned to code one by hand through a class at <a href="https://index-space.org/">Index</a>. Many thanks to <a href="https://megumi.co/">Megumi Tanaka</a> for getting me started. I am currently paying $15 USD a year for my domain and host the code on <a href="https://github.com/zachwhitworth/zachwhitworth.github.io">GitHub</a> for free. My favicon is a portrait of me drawn by my former first-grade student, Taven.
